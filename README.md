# [VCL](https://github.com/vcl/doc) core-modules

A collection of [VCL modules](https://github.com/vcl) that we consider core.
_Core_ includes the components that 80% of all reasonable complex Web apps need.

An icon font is _not_ included to leave this choice open.
You can use any icon font or multiple ones.
There are integration modules for:

- [Font Awesome](https://github.com/vcl/font-awesome)
- [Material Design Icons](https://github.com/vcl/material-design-icons)

Which include the related CSS in the VCL build. This is not a requirement,
however.
